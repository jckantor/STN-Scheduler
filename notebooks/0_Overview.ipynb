    "The following Pyomo model closely follows the development in Kondili, et al. (1993). In particular, the first step in the model is to process the STN data to create sets as given in Kondili.  \n",

    "One important difference from Kondili is the adoption of a more natural time scale that starts at $t = 0$ and extends to $t = H$ (rather than from 1 to H+1).\n",

    "A second difference is the introduction of an additional decision variable denoted by $Q_{j,t}$ indicating the amount of material in unit $j$ at time $t$. A material balance then reads\n",
